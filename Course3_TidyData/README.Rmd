# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repository contains the R script `run_analysis.R` that performs the analysis described in the project prompt.

## Files

- `run_analysis.R`: R script to perform the analysis
- `tidy_data.txt`: Output tidy dataset
- `CodeBook.md`: Descriptions of the variables, the data, and transformations
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the scripts and the analysis

## Steps to Execute the Script

1. Place `run_analysis.R` in your R working directory.
2. Source the script in R: `source("run_analysis.R")`.
3. The script will download and process the data, then output `tidy_data.txt`.

## Summary of the Script

1. Downloads and unzips the dataset if it does not already exist.
2. Reads the data files and merges the training and test sets.
3. Extracts measurements on mean and standard deviation.
4. Uses descriptive activity names.
5. Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
6. Creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
